Passgen
=======

By Brandon Zeek

A quick and easy Python based password generator for Windows.

Click the "Generate" button to produce a password between 8 and 16 characters with a random sequence of letters and numbers.

Please feel free to contribute to this program by adding additional password creation options.

Features I hope to add in the near future include:
  A more cryptographically secure password generator.
  A secure database file to store passwords in.
  Options to change the password output and option to create a pronounceable passphrase.
